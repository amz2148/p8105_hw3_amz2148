# Problem 2



```{r load_activity}
activity = 
  read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% #loads csv file
  janitor::clean_names() %>% #cleans variable names
    pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute", 
    values_to = "activity_lvl") %>% #tidies data into long format
  mutate(day_type = case_when(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday" ~ "weekend", day != "Saturday" | day == "Sunday" ~ "weekday")) %>% #creates day_type variable
  mutate(day = as.factor(day), day_type = as.factor(day_type), minute = as.factor(minute)) %>% #converts character variables to factor
  select(week, day_id, day, day_type, minute, activity_lvl) %>% #reorders columns
  arrange(week, day_id, minute)
```
